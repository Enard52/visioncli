const INSTRUCTIONS = `visioncli lets you see the user's screen so they don't have to paste screenshots.
Use it whenever the user refers to something they are looking at: "this file", "this screen", "what's this error",
"why is this code like this", "look at my simulator", etc.
- Default to \`look\` (captures the window under the mouse, or the front-most non-terminal window if the mouse is on the terminal; target \"screen\" = the display the mouse is on).
- Pass \`app\` when the user names an app ("look at Xcode", "check the simulator").
- Use \`select_region\` when the user wants to point at a specific part of the screen.
- After capturing code, use the window title and visible code to locate the real file in the project, read it,
  and answer with file_path:line references rather than relying only on the pixels.
- For iOS Simulator / Android emulator questions, \`device_screenshot\` gives a clean full-resolution screen; find the view
  in code by grepping for visible strings.
- For database questions ("how are payments and orders related"), use \`db_schema\` / \`db_query\` (read-only, uses the
  project's .env) together with the models/migrations in the code.
- Using the computer (any app): \`ui_elements\` lists the front app's controls with ids → \`click\` / \`type_text\` by id;
  or \`look\` then \`click\` at pixel x/y in that screenshot. \`press_keys\` for Enter/shortcuts, \`scroll\`, \`drag\`, \`open_app\`,
  \`open_url\`. In Chrome/Brave use the browser_* tools instead (never ⌘L/⌘T or typing URLs): they're exact, see into frames
  and reuse tabs; pixel clicks there only for canvas, cross-origin frames or browser dialogs. Work step by step and verify
  with \`look_after: true\` or \`look\`. The user approves actions in a bubble; if they
  decline or press Esc, stop and ask.
- Browser (Brave/Chrome): \`browser_tabs\`, \`browser_open\`, \`browser_switch_tab\`, \`browser_navigate\`, \`browser_read\`,
  \`browser_elements\` → \`browser_click\` / \`browser_type\` / \`browser_select\` (dropdowns) by element id, \`browser_scroll\`. Prefer these over screenshots for
  web pages: they're fast and exact.
- Reporting back later: when you told the user you'd let them know (a build, release, deploy, test run or other background
  work finishing), call \`announce\` with one or two short spoken sentences once it's done. They may be away from the
  terminal; VisionCLI shows it in a bubble and says it out loud. Only for real updates, not for every reply.`;
